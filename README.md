# FARADS_QRAD

FARADS provides a model for calculating view factors of arbitrary three-dimensional geometries. With these view factors the additional application of the net radiation method for calculating exchanged heat fluxes can be used.

FARADS_QRAD is the module providing all functions for calculating heat fluxes by using the net radiation method.
- setting up boundary conditions
- solving for heat fluxes by use of different solvers [1-5]
